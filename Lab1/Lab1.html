<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="basic-building-blocks">Basic Building Blocks</h4>
<p>In this lesson, we will explore some basic building blocks of the R programming language.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=== | 3% | If at any point you’d like more information on a particular topic related to R, you can type help.start() at | the prompt, which will open a menu of resources (either within RStudio or your default web browser, depending | on your setup). Alternatively, a simple web search often yields the answer you’re looking for.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|===== | 5% | In its simplest form, R can be used as an interactive calculator. Type 5 + 7 and press Enter.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>5+7 [1] 12</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are amazing!</p>
<p>|======== | 8% | R simply prints the result of 12 by default. However, R is a programming language and often the reason we use | a programming language as opposed to a calculator is to automate some process or avoid unnecessary | repetition.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=========== | 11% | In this case, we may want to use our result from above in a second calculation. Instead of retyping 5 + 7 | every time we need it, we can just create a new variable that stores the result.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|============= | 13% | The way you assign a value to a variable in R is by using the assignment operator, which is just a ‘less | than’ symbol followed by a ‘minus’ sign. It looks like this: &lt;-</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|================ | 16% | Think of the assignment operator as an arrow. You are assigning the value on the right side of the arrow to | the variable name on the left side of the arrow.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=================== | 18% | To assign the result of 5 + 7 to a new variable called x, you type x &lt;- 5 + 7. This can be read as ‘x gets 5 | plus 7’. Give it a try now.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>x &lt;- 5+7</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s correct!</p>
<p>|===================== | 21% | You’ll notice that R did not print the result of 12 this time. When you use the assignment operator, R | assumes that you don’t want to see the result immediately, but rather that you intend to use the result for | something else later on.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|======================== | 24% | To view the contents of the variable x, just type x and press Enter. Try it now.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>x [1] 12</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excellent job!</p>
<p>|=========================== | 26% | Now, store the result of x - 3 in a new variable called y.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>y &lt;- x-3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that hard work is paying off!</p>
<p>|============================== | 29% | What is the value of y? Type y to find out.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>y [1] 9</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You got it!</p>
<p>|================================ | 32% | Now, let’s create a small collection of numbers called a vector. Any object that contains data is called a | data structure and numeric vectors are the simplest type of data structure in R. In fact, even a single | number is considered a vector of length one.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=================================== | 34% | The easiest way to create a vector is with the c() function, which stands for ‘concatenate’ or ‘combine’. To | create a vector containing the numbers 1.1, 9, and 3.14, type c(1.1, 9, 3.14). Try it now and store the | result in a variable called z.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>c(1.1, 9, 3.14) -&gt; z</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You got it right!</p>
<p>|====================================== | 37% | Anytime you have questions about a particular function, you can access R’s built-in help files via the <code>?</code> | command. For example, if you want more information on the c() function, type ?c without the parentheses that | normally follow a function name. Give it a try.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>?c</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are quite good my friend!</p>
<p>|======================================== | 39% | Type z to view its contents. Notice that there are no commas separating the values in the output.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>z [1] 1.10 9.00 3.14</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep up the great work!</p>
<p>|=========================================== | 42% | You can combine vectors to make a new vector. Create a new vector that contains z, 555, then z again in that | order. Don’t assign this vector to a new variable, so that we can just see the result immediately.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>c(z, 555, z) [1] 1.10 9.00 3.14 555.00 1.10 9.00 3.14</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your dedication is inspiring!</p>
<p>|============================================== | 45% | Numeric vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions. Type the following to see what happens: z * 2 + 100.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>z*2+100 [1] 102.20 118.00 106.28</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that hard work is paying off!</p>
<p>|================================================ | 47% | First, R multiplied each of the three elements in z by 2. Then it added 100 to each element to get the result | you see above.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=================================================== | 50% | Other common arithmetic operators are <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>/</code>, and <code>^</code> (where x^2 means ‘x squared’). To take the | square root, use the sqrt() function and to take the absolute value, use the abs() function.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|====================================================== | 53% | Take the square root of z - 1 and assign it to a new variable called my_sqrt.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_sqrt &lt;- sqrt(z-1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s correct!</p>
<p>|======================================================== | 55% | Before we view the contents of the my_sqrt variable, what do you think it contains?</p>
<p>1: a vector of length 0 (i.e.&nbsp;an empty vector) 2: a vector of length 3 3: a single number (i.e a vector of length 1)</p>
<p>Выбор:1</p>
<p>You are amazing!</p>
<p>|=========================================================== | 58% | Print the contents of my_sqrt.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_sqrt [1] 0.3162278 2.8284271 1.4628739</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excellent work!</p>
<p>|============================================================== | 61% | As you may have guessed, R first subtracted 1 from each element of z, then took the square root of each | element. This leaves you with a vector of the same length as the original vector z.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|================================================================ | 63% | Now, create a new variable called my_div that gets the value of z divided by my_sqrt.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_div &lt;- z / my_sqrt</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep up the great work!</p>
<p>|=================================================================== | 66% | Which statement do you think is true?</p>
<p>1: The first element of my_div is equal to the first element of z divided by the first element of my_sqrt, and so on… 2: my_div is a single number (i.e a vector of length 1) 3: my_div is undefined</p>
<p>Выбор:1</p>
<p>You are really on a roll!</p>
<p>|====================================================================== | 68% | Go ahead and print the contents of my_div.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_div [1] 3.478505 3.181981 2.146460</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a job well done!</p>
<p>|======================================================================== | 71% | When given two vectors of the same length, R simply performs the specified arithmetic operation (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, | <code>*</code>, etc.) element-by-element. If the vectors are of different lengths, R ‘recycles’ the shorter vector until | it is the same length as the longer vector.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=========================================================================== | 74% | When we did z * 2 + 100 in our earlier example, z was a vector of length 3, but technically 2 and 100 are | each vectors of length 1.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|============================================================================== | 76% | Behind the scenes, R is ‘recycling’ the 2 to make a vector of 2s and the 100 to make a vector of 100s. In | other words, when you ask R to compute z * 2 + 100, what it really computes is this: z * c(2, 2, 2) + c(100, | 100, 100).</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|================================================================================= | 79% | To see another example of how this vector ‘recycling’ works, try adding c(1, 2, 3, 4) and c(0, 10). Don’t | worry about saving the result in a new variable.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10) [1] 1 12 3 14</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that practice is paying off!</p>
<p>|=================================================================================== | 82% | If the length of the shorter vector does not divide evenly into the length of the longer vector, R will still | apply the ‘recycling’ method, but will throw a warning to let you know something fishy might be going on.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|====================================================================================== | 84% | Try c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) for an example.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) [1] 1 12 103 4 Warning message: In c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) : longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excellent job!</p>
<p>|========================================================================================= | 87% | Before concluding this lesson, I’d like to show you a couple of time-saving tricks.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=========================================================================================== | 89% | Earlier in the lesson, you computed z * 2 + 100. Let’s pretend that you made a mistake and that you meant to | add 1000 instead of 100. You could either re-type the expression, or…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|============================================================================================== | 92% | In many programming environments, the up arrow will cycle through previous commands. Try hitting the up arrow | on your keyboard until you get to this command (z * 2 + 100), then change 100 to 1000 and hit Enter. If the | up arrow doesn’t work for you, just type the corrected command.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>z*2+1000 [1] 1002.20 1018.00 1006.28</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’re the best!</p>
<p>|================================================================================================= | 95% | Finally, let’s pretend you’d like to view the contents of a variable that you created earlier, but you can’t | seem to remember if you named it my_div or myDiv. You could try both and see what works, or…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=================================================================================================== | 97% | You can type the first two letters of the variable name, then hit the Tab key (possibly more than once). Most | programming environments will provide a list of variables that you’ve created that begin with ‘my’. This is | called auto-completion and can be quite handy when you have many variables in your workspace. Give it a try. | (If auto-completion doesn’t work for you, just type my_div and press Enter.)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_div [1] 3.478505 3.181981 2.146460</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that practice is paying off!</p>
<p>|======================================================================================================| 100%</p>

<section id="workspace-and-files" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="workspace-and-files">Workspace and Files</h4>
<p>In this lesson, you’ll learn how to examine your local workspace in R and begin to explore the relationship<br>
between your workspace and the file system of your machine.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=== | 3% | Because different operating systems have different conventions with regards to things like file paths, the | outputs of these commands may vary across machines.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|===== | 5% | However it’s important to note that R provides a common API (a common set of commands) for interacting with | files, that way your code will work across different kinds of computers.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|======== | 8% | Let’s jump right in so you can get a feel for how these special functions work!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|========== | 10% | Determine which directory your R session is using as its current working directory using getwd().</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>getwd() [1] “C:/Users/max-2/Documents/RS/Lab1”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perseverance, that’s the answer.</p>
<p>|============= | 13% | List all the objects in your local workspace using ls().</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>ls() [1] “my_div” “my_sqrt” “x” “y” “z”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep up the great work!</p>
<p>|================ | 15% | Some R commands are the same as their equivalents commands on Linux or on a Mac. Both Linux and Mac operating | systems are based on an operating system called Unix. It’s always a good idea to learn more about Unix!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|================== | 18% | Assign 9 to x using x &lt;- 9.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>x &lt;- 9</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perseverance, that’s the answer.</p>
<p>|===================== | 21% | Now take a look at objects that are in your workspace using ls().</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>ls() [1] “my_div” “my_sqrt” “x” “y” “z”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are quite good my friend!</p>
<p>|======================== | 23% | List all the files in your working directory using list.files() or dir().</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>dir() [1] “_quarto.yml” “Lab1.qmd” “Lab1.Rproj”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excellent job!</p>
<p>|========================== | 26% | As we go through this lesson, you should be examining the help page for each new function. Check out the help | page for list.files with the command ?list.files.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>?list.files</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are doing so well!</p>
<p>|============================= | 28% | One of the most helpful parts of any R help file is the See Also section. Read that section for list.files. | Some of these functions may be used in later portions of this lesson.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=============================== | 31% | Using the args() function on a function name is also a handy way to see what arguments a function can take.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|================================== | 33% | Use the args() function to determine the arguments to list.files().</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>args(list.files) function (path = “.”, pattern = NULL, all.files = FALSE, full.names = FALSE, recursive = FALSE, ignore.case = FALSE, include.dirs = FALSE, no.. = FALSE) NULL</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You got it right!</p>
<p>|===================================== | 36% | Assign the value of the current working directory to a variable called “old.dir”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>old.dir &lt;- getwd()</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excellent work!</p>
<p>|======================================= | 38% | We will use old.dir at the end of this lesson to move back to the place that we started. A lot of query | functions like getwd() have the useful property that they return the answer to the question as a result of | the function.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|========================================== | 41% | Use dir.create() to create a directory in the current working directory called “testdir”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>dir.create(“testdir”)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You got it!</p>
<p>|============================================ | 44% | We will do all our work in this new directory and then delete it after we are done. This is the R analog to | “Take only pictures, leave only footprints.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=============================================== | 46% | Set your working directory to “testdir” with the setwd() command.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>setwd(“testdir”)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You got it right!</p>
<p>|================================================== | 49% | In general, you will want your working directory to be someplace sensible, perhaps created for the specific | project that you are working on. In fact, organizing your work in R packages using RStudio is an excellent | option. Check out RStudio at http://www.rstudio.com/</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|==================================================== | 51% | Create a file in your working directory called “mytest.R” using the file.create() function.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>file.create(“mytest.R”) [1] TRUE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perseverance, that’s the answer.</p>
<p>|======================================================= | 54% | This should be the only file in this newly created directory. Let’s check this by listing all the files in | the current directory.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>list.files() [1] “myTest.R”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perseverance, that’s the answer.</p>
<p>|========================================================== | 56% | Check to see if “mytest.R” exists in the working directory using the file.exists() function.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>file.exists(“mytest.R”) [1] TRUE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perseverance, that’s the answer.</p>
<p>|============================================================ | 59% | These sorts of functions are excessive for interactive use. But, if you are running a program that loops | through a series of files and does some processing on each one, you will want to check to see that each | exists before you try to process it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=============================================================== | 62% | Access information about the file “mytest.R” by using file.info().</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>file.info(“mytest.R”) size isdir mode mtime ctime atime exe mytest.R 0 FALSE 666 2023-09-21 16:58:48 2023-09-21 16:58:21 2023-09-21 16:58:48 no</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perseverance, that’s the answer.</p>
<p>|================================================================= | 64% | You can use the $ operator — e.g., file.info(“mytest.R”)$mode — to grab specific items.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|==================================================================== | 67% | Change the name of the file “mytest.R” to “mytest2.R” by using file.rename().</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>file.rename(“mytest.R”, “mytest2.R”) [1] TRUE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great job!</p>
<p>|======================================================================= | 69% | Your operating system will provide simpler tools for these sorts of tasks, but having the ability to | manipulate files programatically is useful. You might now try to delete mytest.R using | file.remove(‘mytest.R’), but that won’t work since mytest.R no longer exists. You have already renamed it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|========================================================================= | 72% | Make a copy of “mytest2.R” called “mytest3.R” using file.copy().</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>file.copy(“mytest2.R”, “mytest3.R”) [1] TRUE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that practice is paying off!</p>
<p>|============================================================================ | 74% | You now have two files in the current directory. That may not seem very interesting. But what if you were | working with dozens, or millions, of individual files? In that case, being able to programatically act on | many files would be absolutely necessary. Don’t forget that you can, temporarily, leave the lesson by typing | play() and then return by typing nxt().</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|============================================================================== | 77% | Provide the relative path to the file “mytest3.R” by using file.path().</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>file.path(“mystest3.R”) [1] “mystest3.R”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s not the answer I was looking for, but try again. Or, type info() for more options.</p>
<p>file.path(“mytest3.R”) works.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>file.path(“mytest3.R”) [1] “mytest3.R”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excellent work!</p>
<p>|================================================================================= | 79% | You can use file.path to construct file and directory paths that are independent of the operating system your | R code is running on. Pass ‘folder1’ and ‘folder2’ as arguments to file.path to make a platform-independent | pathname.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>file.path(‘folder1’, ‘folder2’) [1] “folder1/folder2”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep working like that and you’ll get there!</p>
<p>|==================================================================================== | 82% | Take a look at the documentation for dir.create by entering ?dir.create . Notice the ‘recursive’ argument. In | order to create nested directories, ‘recursive’ must be set to TRUE.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>?dir.create</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that hard work is paying off!</p>
<p>|====================================================================================== | 85% | Create a directory in the current working directory called “testdir2” and a subdirectory for it called | “testdir3”, all in one command by using dir.create() and file.path().</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>dir.create(file.path(“testdir2”, “testdir3”), recursive = TRUE) Warning message: In dir.create(file.path(“testdir2”, “testdir3”), recursive = TRUE) : ‘testdir2’ already exists</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You got it right!</p>
<p>|========================================================================================= | 87% | Go back to your original working directory using setwd(). (Recall that we created the variable old.dir with | the full path for the orginal working directory at the start of these questions.)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>setwd(old.dir)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excellent job!</p>
<p>|============================================================================================ | 90% | It is often helpful to save the settings that you had before you began an analysis and then go back to them | at the end. This trick is often used within functions; you save, say, the par() settings that you started | with, mess around a bunch, and then set them back to the original values at the end. This isn’t the same as | what we have done here, but it seems similar enough to mention.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|============================================================================================== | 92% | After you finish this lesson delete the ‘testdir’ directory that you just left (and everything in it)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|================================================================================================= | 95% | Take nothing but results. Leave nothing but assumptions. That sounds like ‘Take nothing but pictures. Leave | nothing but footprints.’ But it makes no sense! Surely our readers can come up with a better motto . . .</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=================================================================================================== | 97% | In this lesson, you learned how to examine your R workspace and work with the file system of your machine | from within R. Thanks for playing!</p>
<p>…</p>

<p>In this lesson, you’ll learn how to create sequences of numbers in R.</p>

<p>|==== | 4% | The simplest way to create a sequence of numbers in R is by using the <code>:</code> operator. Type 1:20 to see how it | works.</p>

<p>You are amazing!</p>
<p>|========= | 9% | That gave us every integer between (and including) 1 and 20. We could also use it to create a sequence of | real numbers. For example, try pi:10.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>pi:10 [1] 3.141593 4.141593 5.141593 6.141593 7.141593 8.141593 9.141593</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great job!</p>
<p>|============= | 13% | The result is a vector of real numbers starting with pi (3.142…) and increasing in increments of 1. The | upper limit of 10 is never reached, since the next number in our sequence would be greater than 10.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|================== | 17% | What happens if we do 15:1? Give it a try to find out.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>15:1 [1] 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are amazing!</p>
<p>|====================== | 22% | It counted backwards in increments of 1! It’s unlikely we’d want this behavior, but nonetheless it’s good to | know how it could happen.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=========================== | 26% | Remember that if you have questions about a particular R function, you can access its documentation with a | question mark followed by the function name: ?function_name_here. However, in the case of an operator like | the colon used above, you must enclose the symbol in backticks like this: ?<code>:</code>. (NOTE: The backtick (`) key | is generally located in the top left corner of a keyboard, above the Tab key. If you don’t have a backtick | key, you can use regular quotes.)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=============================== | 30% | Pull up the documentation for <code>:</code> now.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>?<code>:</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s correct!</p>
<p>|=================================== | 35% | Often, we’ll desire more control over a sequence we’re creating than what the <code>:</code> operator gives us. The | seq() function serves this purpose.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|======================================== | 39% | The most basic use of seq() does exactly the same thing as the <code>:</code> operator. Try seq(1, 20) to see this.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>seq(1, 20) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You nailed it! Good job!</p>
<p>|============================================ | 43% | This gives us the same output as 1:20. However, let’s say that instead we want a vector of numbers ranging | from 0 to 10, incremented by 0.5. seq(0, 10, by=0.5) does just that. Try it out.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>seq(0, 10, by=0.5) [1] 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 9.0 9.5 10.0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a job well done!</p>
<p>|================================================= | 48% | Or maybe we don’t care what the increment is and we just want a sequence of 30 numbers between 5 and 10. | seq(5, 10, length=30) does the trick. Give it a shot now and store the result in a new variable called | my_seq.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_seq &lt;- seq(5, 10, length=30)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’re the best!</p>
<p>|===================================================== | 52% | To confirm that my_seq has length 30, we can use the length() function. Try it now.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_seq [1] 5.000000 5.172414 5.344828 5.517241 5.689655 5.862069 6.034483 6.206897 6.379310 6.551724 [11] 6.724138 6.896552 7.068966 7.241379 7.413793 7.586207 7.758621 7.931034 8.103448 8.275862 [21] 8.448276 8.620690 8.793103 8.965517 9.137931 9.310345 9.482759 9.655172 9.827586 10.000000</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice try, but that’s not exactly what I was hoping for. Try again. Or, type info() for more options.</p>
<p>Use length(my_seq) to view the length of the my_seq variable.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>length(my_seq) [1] 30</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s the answer I was looking for.</p>
<p>|========================================================== | 57% | Let’s pretend we don’t know the length of my_seq, but we want to generate a sequence of integers from 1 to N, | where N represents the length of the my_seq vector. In other words, we want a new vector (1, 2, 3, …) that | is the same length as my_seq.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|============================================================== | 61% | There are several ways we could do this. One possibility is to combine the <code>:</code> operator and the length() | function like this: 1:length(my_seq). Give that a try.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>1:length(my_seq) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are really on a roll!</p>
<p>|=================================================================== | 65% | Another option is to use seq(along.with = my_seq). Give that a try.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>seq(along.with = my_seq) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perseverance, that’s the answer.</p>
<p>|======================================================================= | 70% | However, as is the case with many common tasks, R has a separate built-in function for this purpose called | seq_along(). Type seq_along(my_seq) to see it in action.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>seq_along(my_seq) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You got it right!</p>
<p>|=========================================================================== | 74% | There are often several approaches to solving the same problem, particularly in R. Simple approaches that | involve less typing are generally best. It’s also important for your code to be readable, so that you and | others can figure out what’s going on without too much hassle.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|================================================================================ | 78% | If R has a built-in function for a particular task, it’s likely that function is highly optimized for that | purpose and is your best option. As you become a more advanced R programmer, you’ll design your own functions | to perform tasks when there are no better options. We’ll explore writing your own functions in future | lessons.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|==================================================================================== | 83% | One more function related to creating sequences of numbers is rep(), which stands for ‘replicate’. Let’s look | at a few uses.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|========================================================================================= | 87% | If we’re interested in creating a vector that contains 40 zeros, we can use rep(0, times = 40). Try it out.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>rep(0, times = 40) [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’re the best!</p>
<p>|============================================================================================= | 91% | If instead we want our vector to contain 10 repetitions of the vector (0, 1, 2), we can do rep(c(0, 1, 2), | times = 10). Go ahead.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10) [1] 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are quite good my friend!</p>
<p>|================================================================================================== | 96% | Finally, let’s say that rather than repeating the vector (0, 1, 2) over and over again, we want our vector to | contain 10 zeros, then 10 ones, then 10 twos. We can do this with the <code>each</code> argument. Try rep(c(0, 1, 2), | each = 10).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 10) [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2</p>

<section id="vectors" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vectors">Vectors</h4>
<p>| | 0%</p>
<p>The simplest and most common data structure in R is the vector.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=== | 3% | Vectors come in two different flavors: atomic vectors and lists. An atomic vector contains exactly one data | type, whereas a list may contain multiple data types. We’ll explore atomic vectors further before we get to | lists.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|===== | 5% | In previous lessons, we dealt entirely with numeric vectors, which are one type of atomic vector. Other types | of atomic vectors include logical, character, integer, and complex. In this lesson, we’ll take a closer look | at logical and character vectors.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|======== | 8% | Logical vectors can contain the values TRUE, FALSE, and NA (for ‘not available’). These values are generated | as the result of logical ‘conditions’. Let’s experiment with some simple conditions.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=========== | 11% | First, create a numeric vector num_vect that contains the values 0.5, 55, -10, and 6.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>c(0.5, 55, -10, 6) -&gt; num_vect</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep working like that and you’ll get there!</p>
<p>|============= | 13% | Now, create a variable called tf that gets the result of num_vect &lt; 1, which is read as ‘num_vect is less | than 1’.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>tf &lt;- num_vect &lt; 1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You got it!</p>
<p>|================ | 16% | What do you think tf will look like?</p>
<p>1: a single logical value 2: a vector of 4 logical values</p>
<p>Выбор:2</p>
<p>All that practice is paying off!</p>
<p>|=================== | 18% | Print the contents of tf now.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>tf [1] TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s correct!</p>
<p>|===================== | 21% | The statement num_vect &lt; 1 is a condition and tf tells us whether each corresponding element of our numeric | vector num_vect satisfies this condition.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|======================== | 24% | The first element of num_vect is 0.5, which is less than 1 and therefore the statement 0.5 &lt; 1 is TRUE. The | second element of num_vect is 55, which is greater than 1, so the statement 55 &lt; 1 is FALSE. The same logic | applies for the third and fourth elements.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=========================== | 26% | Let’s try another. Type num_vect &gt;= 6 without assigning the result to a new variable.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>num_vect &gt;= 6 [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are quite good my friend!</p>
<p>|============================== | 29% | This time, we are asking whether each individual element of num_vect is greater than OR equal to 6. Since | only 55 and 6 are greater than or equal to 6, the second and fourth elements of the result are TRUE and the | first and third elements are FALSE.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|================================ | 32% | The <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;=</code> symbols in these examples are called ‘logical operators’. Other logical operators include | <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>==</code> for exact equality, and <code>!=</code> for inequality.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=================================== | 34% | If we have two logical expressions, A and B, we can ask whether at least one is TRUE with A | B (logical ‘or’ | a.k.a. ‘union’) or whether they are both TRUE with A &amp; B (logical ‘and’ a.k.a. ‘intersection’). Lastly, !A is | the negation of A and is TRUE when A is FALSE and vice versa.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|====================================== | 37% | It’s a good idea to spend some time playing around with various combinations of these logical operators until | you get comfortable with their use. We’ll do a few examples here to get you started.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|======================================== | 39% | Try your best to predict the result of each of the following statements. You can use pencil and paper to work | them out if it’s helpful. If you get stuck, just guess and you’ve got a 50% chance of getting the right | answer!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=========================================== | 42% | (3 &gt; 5) &amp; (4 == 4)</p>
<p>1: FALSE 2: TRUE</p>
<p>Выбор:1</p>
<p>Your dedication is inspiring!</p>
<p>|============================================== | 45% | (TRUE == TRUE) | (TRUE == FALSE)</p>
<p>1: FALSE 2: TRUE</p>
<p>Выбор:2</p>
<p>Great job!</p>
<p>|================================================ | 47% | ((111 &gt;= 111) | !(TRUE)) &amp; ((4 + 1) == 5)</p>
<p>1: FALSE 2: TRUE</p>
<p>Выбор:2</p>
<p>You are quite good my friend!</p>
<p>|=================================================== | 50% | Don’t worry if you found these to be tricky. They’re supposed to be. Working with logical statements in R | takes practice, but your efforts will be rewarded in future lessons (e.g.&nbsp;subsetting and control structures).</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|====================================================== | 53% | Character vectors are also very common in R. Double quotes are used to distinguish character objects, as in | the following example.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|======================================================== | 55% | Create a character vector that contains the following words: “My”, “name”, “is”. Remember to enclose each | word in its own set of double quotes, so that R knows they are character strings. Store the vector in a | variable called my_char.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>c(“My”, “name”, “is”) -&gt; my_char</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You got it right!</p>
<p>|=========================================================== | 58% | Print the contents of my_char to see what it looks like.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_char [1] “My” “name” “is”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’re the best!</p>
<p>|============================================================== | 61% | Right now, my_char is a character vector of length 3. Let’s say we want to join the elements of my_char | together into one continuous character string (i.e.&nbsp;a character vector of length 1). We can do this using the | paste() function.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|================================================================ | 63% | Type paste(my_char, collapse = ” “) now. Make sure there’s a space between the double quotes in the | <code>collapse</code> argument. You’ll see why in a second.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>paste(my_char, collapse = ” “) [1]”My name is”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your dedication is inspiring!</p>
<p>|=================================================================== | 66% | The <code>collapse</code> argument to the paste() function tells R that when we join together the elements of the | my_char character vector, we’d like to separate them with single spaces.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|====================================================================== | 68% | It seems that we’re missing something…. Ah, yes! Your name!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|======================================================================== | 71% | To add (or ‘concatenate’) your name to the end of my_char, use the c() function like this: c(my_char, | “your_name_here”). Place your name in double quotes where I’ve put “your_name_here”. Try it now, storing the | result in a new variable called my_name.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>c(my_char, “GolubGleb”) -&gt; my_name</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excellent work!</p>
<p>|=========================================================================== | 74% | Take a look at the contents of my_name.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_name [1] “My” “name” “is” “GolubGleb”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are amazing!</p>
<p>|============================================================================== | 76% | Now, use the paste() function once more to join the words in my_name together into a single character string. | Don’t forget to say collapse = ” “!</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>paste(my_name, collapse = ” “) [1]”My name is GolubGleb”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice work!</p>
<p>|================================================================================= | 79% | In this example, we used the paste() function to collapse the elements of a single character vector. paste() | can also be used to join the elements of multiple character vectors.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=================================================================================== | 82% | In the simplest case, we can join two character vectors that are each of length 1 (i.e.&nbsp;join two words). Try | paste(“Hello”, “world!”, sep = ” “), where the <code>sep</code> argument tells R that we want to separate the joined | elements with a single space.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>paste(“Hello”, “world!”, sep = ” “) [1]”Hello world!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a job well done!</p>
<p>|====================================================================================== | 84% | For a slightly more complicated example, we can join two vectors, each of length 3. Use paste() to join the | integer vector 1:3 with the character vector c(“X”, “Y”, “Z”). This time, use sep = “” to leave no space | between the joined elements.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>paste(1:3, c(“X”, “Y”, “Z”), sep = ““) [1]”1X” “2Y” “3Z”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You got it right!</p>
<p>|========================================================================================= | 87% | What do you think will happen if our vectors are of different length? (Hint: we talked about this in a | previous lesson.)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=========================================================================================== | 89% | Vector recycling! Try paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = “-”), where LETTERS is a predefined variable in R containing | a character vector of all 26 letters in the English alphabet.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = “-”) [1] “A-1” “B-2” “C-3” “D-4” “E-1” “F-2” “G-3” “H-4” “I-1” “J-2” “K-3” “L-4” “M-1” “N-2” “O-3” “P-4” “Q-1” “R-2” [19] “S-3” “T-4” “U-1” “V-2” “W-3” “X-4” “Y-1” “Z-2”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great job!</p>
<p>|============================================================================================== | 92% | Since the character vector LETTERS is longer than the numeric vector 1:4, R simply recycles, or repeats, 1:4 | until it matches the length of LETTERS.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|================================================================================================= | 95% | Also worth noting is that the numeric vector 1:4 gets ‘coerced’ into a character vector by the paste() | function.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=================================================================================================== | 97% | We’ll discuss coercion in another lesson, but all it really means is that the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the | output above are no longer numbers to R, but rather characters “1”, “2”, “3”, and “4”.</p>
<p>…</p>
